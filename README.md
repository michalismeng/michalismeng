### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Michalis, a Software Engineer with a background in DevOps, focused on building automated infrastructure, designing CI/CD pipelines and deploying stuff on Kubernetes.

My main interests lie in creating reliable systems and in my free time I enjoy exploring the intersection of programming and finance.
