### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Michalis, a Software Engineer with a background in DevOps, focused on building automated infrastructure, designing CI/CD pipelines and deploying stuff on Kubernetes.

My main interests lie in creating reliable systems and in my free time I enjoy exploring the intersection of programming and finance.

I'm currently building [AssetBloom](https://assetbloom.io) - a tool to help people build robust and globally diversified portfolios.

Feel free to reach out to me via [email](mailto:michalis.mengisoglou@gmail.com) or connect via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michalis-mengisoglou/).
